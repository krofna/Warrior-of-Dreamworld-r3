Here, I'll present my Factory System.
'Kay.

What about an polymorphic Factory System ?
Difficulty : Easy.
Need a Base class.
And we can instanciate other Derived class from Base.
Problem : We need to instanciate a lot of instances of the Factory System, and it may cost a lot.

What about an "all" Factory System ?
Difficulty : Insane.
You can instanciate all types.
A type safety weaker.
Problem : Type retrieving

Currently, we have an all Factory System, which works quite well after some tests.
